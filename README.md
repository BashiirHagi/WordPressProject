# WordpressProject
I created a WordPress site on a ubuntu server 18.04.6 TLS running in the US-east-1 (N.Virgina) on AWS Cloud. I installed apache2 webserver on my virtual server with MySQL, and PHP. I allocated an elastic IP address and registered a domain name using Route 53 (AWS) for the WordPress site. You can access it using - 3.220.165.196 or http://techwithbashiir.com/.  

I undertook this personal project to demonstrate my AWS and Linux system administration skills. The key goals of this project were:  

- The WordPress site needed to be highly available and operational at all times 

- It must meet minimal performance requirements for reliability purposes
